Scripts are used to interact with the data in a base. Currently, python and javascript are available as script languages.

Javascript is executed directly in the user's browser, requires no authentication, and is used for simple data operations.

Python, on the other hand, is executed on the SeaTable server. Unlike javascript, every Python script requires authentication and is suitable for more extensive automations and processes.
